Copilot generated several core functions in my script, including the initial data-loading block, a basic missing-value handler, and a simple loop for cleaning column names. I prompted it by writing short comments such as "# load the CSV file" or by typing partial function signatures. Copilot then suggested full code blocks that I accepted as a starting point.
I updated variable names to be clearer, simplified some of the logic to avoid unnecessary loops, and added safety checks that Copilot did not include. I also rewrote parts of the missing-value handling to ensure the behavior was consistent with my project requirements. These changes were needed to improve readability, correctness, and maintainability.
I learned how common data-cleaning tasks in Python—such as handling missing values, normalizing column names, and converting data types—can be efficiently implemented. Copilot is helpful for generating quick boilerplate code, but it occasionally produces assumptions that don’t fit the project, so review is essential. For example, Copilot suggested dropping all rows with missing values, which would have removed important data; I changed it to a more selective approach. This taught me that Copilot is a great assistant but not a substitute for understanding the logic.
